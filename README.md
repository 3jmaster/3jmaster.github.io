# Welcome to fab's

## What I do:

Hi, as you can see I am not the best UI designer. I tend to be the backend-kinda guy. ;)

In the day, I am a full-time, full-stack DevSecOps Engineer for a governemnt Platform-as-a-Service

Other times, I give talks, workshops, hack, build, and evangelise on the important of security.

Some of my contributions can be found on DevSecOps.org, DevSecOpsSG, RSA and DevSecCon.

I write some [Medium](https://medium.com/@3jmaster) occassionally to bring security concepts for the normal human beings - for I believe that we are the weakest link.
